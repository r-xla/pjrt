// The dispatcher's backend abstraction.
//
// The dispatcher core (dispatch.cpp) is backend-agnostic: it flattens a call,
// classifies the leaves, builds the cache key, and drives the LRU + compile
// protocol. Everything a backend has an opinion about lives behind the Engine
// interface defined here:
//
//   * how an Aval is read off one of the backend's arrays,
//   * what a cache entry holds (the compile callback's artifacts),
//   * how a call executes against an entry, and how its outputs are wrapped.
//
// PjrtEngine is the fast path for the "xla" backend: avals come off a
// PJRTBuffer's cached native metadata, inputs are assembled and executed
// natively, and the output buffers are wrapped into AnvlArrays and re-nested
// without leaving C++. ClosureEngine is the generic vehicle for any other
// backend (anvl's quickr, or one pjrt has never heard of): the entry holds a
// compiled R closure that is called on the flat leaves and returns the finished
// value, so the backend keeps full control over execution and wrapping.

// parses the array's own fields. Only `$data` is guaranteed by anvl's backend
// contract, so `aval`/`device`/`backend` come from the buffer (PjrtEngine) or
// an extractor (ClosureEngine), never from a fixed field layout.
//
