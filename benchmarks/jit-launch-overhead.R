# Benchmark: what one cache-hit call to anvl's jit() costs, and how much of
# that is pjrt's native dispatcher.
#
# A jitted function that has already compiled its executable pays, on every
# subsequent call, only *launch* overhead: capture the arguments, key the cache,
# find the executable, hand the input buffers to PJRT, wrap the outputs. None of
# that is device compute. This benchmark peels that cost apart into three nested
# layers, each a strict superset of the one below, all measured on the same
# elementwise `x + y` over f32 arrays:
#
#   0. execute    the floor: impl_loaded_executable_execute(), the very call the
#                 dispatcher makes once it has found its entry, driven directly
#                 from R on a pre-built input list and cached execute options.
#                 Nothing above this line can be removed without removing PJRT.
#   1. dispatch   pjrt's native dispatcher on a cache hit: flatten the args,
#                 build and hash the cache key, look it up, assemble the
#                 inputs, execute, wrap the output buffers into AnvlArrays and
#                 re-nest them. This is the whole per-call machinery -- anvl's
#                 jitted closure adds nothing but argument capture on top, so
#                 dispatch(disp, args) and the closure's "jit_run_args" fast
#                 entry are the same layer.
#   2. jit call   the jitted closure itself: layer 1 plus the match.call() +
#                 eval() argument capture. This is what a user pays.
#
# Successive differences therefore attribute the overhead:
#
#   machinery_us = (1) - (0)                   the dispatcher (keying, input
#                                              assembly, native output wrap)
#   capture_us   = (2) - (1)                   anvl's argument capture
#   compute_us   = roundtrip - (2) - await_us  the device work, alone
#
# `pjrt_execute_us` times the R-level pjrt_execute() on the same floor
# executable. It is not a floor but a comparison: a plain R wrapper around the
# same execute costs about what the entire native dispatcher costs.
#
# Layer 0 and `pjrt_execute_us` drive a hand-written add compiled here; layers
# 1-2 drive the equivalent program anvl traced. Both are one stablehlo.add over
# the same shapes, and at n = 1 and n = 100 the two agree to well under a
# microsecond -- but `machinery_us` is a difference across them, so read it as
# "about ten microseconds", not to two decimals.
#
# Reaching impl_loaded_executable_execute() and impl_execution_options_create()
# needs getFromNamespace(): they are Rcpp entry points, deliberately not
# exported. Nothing else here touches a package internal.
#
# Async handling. pjrt_execute() returns before the device has computed
# anything, so layers 0-2 measure launch alone. Inputs are await()ed before
# timing. `roundtrip` additionally await()s the output, and so carries both the
# device wait and await()'s own call cost -- which is why `await_us` is measured
# separately, on an output that is already ready, and subtracted out. It is
# around 5 us and does not vary with n, so leaving it in would triple the
# apparent device time of a scalar add.
#
# A launch still *enqueues* work and allocates its output buffer, so a tight
# loop of un-awaited launches would measure the queue and the allocator rather
# than R-level dispatch. Each timed loop is therefore sized to keep the
# outstanding output bytes bounded (`reps_for()`), and every result it produced
# is await()ed once the clock has stopped.
#
# Even so, at the largest size one launch allocates 4 MB and its cost swings by
# more than a whole launch layer, so the layer decomposition is reported only
# for the sizes where every layer clears that noise floor. Launch overhead is a
# fixed cost; the large size is there to show what it takes to amortise it,
# which the second table does.
#
# The Python counterpart (jax.jit on the same add, same sizes) lives in anvl's
# benchmarks/jax-launch-overhead.py and prints a directly comparable launch_us.
#
# Usage:  Rscript benchmarks/jit-launch-overhead.R
# Requires: anvl, built against this pjrt. Set PJRT_NPROC=1 to pin the CPU
# client to one thread (the default fans out and makes `compute_us` noisier).
